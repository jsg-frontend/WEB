<h2>Java script</h2>
<P>JavaScript (English: JavaScript) is an object-based scripting programming language. This language is mainly used within web browsers, and has the ability to access built-in objects of other application programs. It is also used for server programming like a runtime environment such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation, initially under the name Mocha, and later under the name LiveScript, and finally became JavaScript. JavaScript has similar syntax to Sun Microsystems' Java, but this is actually because both languages ​​are based on the basic syntax of the C language, and Java and JavaScript are not directly related. Other than the name and syntax, it has more similarities to self or scheme than Java.</P>

<P>As of January 2013, the most recent version is JavaScript 1.8.5[3], and is supported by Firefox 3. The JavaScript version corresponding to the standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition is 1.5. ECMAScript is simply a standardized version of JavaScript. With the release of Mozilla 1.8 Beta 1, E4X (ECMA-357), an extension language corresponding to XML, was partially supported. Each browser supports different versions of JavaScript.</P>
