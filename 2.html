<h2>CSS</h2>
<P>Dependent sheets or Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are languages that describe how the markup language is actually displayed [1]. It is mainly used in HTML and XHTML, and can also be used in XML. It is the standard of the W3C, and has a high degree of freedom in defining the layout and style.</P>

<P>If the markup language (ex: HTML) is in charge of the body of the website, CSS is in charge of decorating it like clothes and accessories. In other words, you can decorate like a completely different website by changing the CSS file while leaving the HTML structure intact.</P>

<P>In the case of CSS3, which is currently under development, a function that can replace images created with graphic editing programs such as shadow effects, gradients, and transformations has been added. In addition, various animation functions have been added to some extent replace Adobe Flash.</P>
